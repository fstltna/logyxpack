150 games, mostly logic, under one window:<br>
BTM Pro (Net+), Yap Yamb (Net+), Yea Chess, Monopoly INT, Puzz, Geex, Moc, Zookey, Thux, Zoodoku, Memory, Tac 3D, Minesweeper, Battleships, Dominow, Micro Mastermind, Panel de Pon, Tetris, Hextris, Tangram, Checkers, Chinese Checkers, PushNPull Sokoban, Connect Four, GoMoku, Reversi, Hanoi, Inertia, Klotski, Sudoku, Fifteen, Kakuro, Byss 2048, Snakes and Ladders, Simon Says, Finty Flush, Zuma Twisted, Solitaire, Mahjong, Backgammon, Klopodrom...
<br><br>Logyx Pack can be played in variable window size, or fixed window size, or full screen. For most of these games you can adjust options to make them suitable for almost any age player. They all have basic but understandable descriptions.<br>BTM Pro (Net+) consists of 3 card games Briscola, Tressette and Madrasso. Play ordinary or double type of Briscola, and Tressette with or without declarations. Cards are one player vs computer, or network game (2 players, or 4 players in 2 pairs) over LAN/Internet.<br>Yap Yamb (Net+) (Jamb) is a 4 column, advanced Yahtzee-like, dice game for 1 to 5 players. Play it vs computer player(s) or your friends, offline or on a LAN/Internet. Customize number of players, type of players, disabled columns and rows, number of dices, additional roll. There is also detailed statistics.<br>Yea Chess is a chess vs computer. It has a simple interface and quick and strong artificial intelligence. You can adjust the strength of the computer player and save games.<br>Monopoly INT is a classic Monopoly board game for 2 to 4 players with a twist. Main twist in layout is that streets are replaced by countries. Monopoly INT rules are dynamic and flexible, and the difference is also that all the properties in a color must be owned by any of players to buy the houses and hotels.<br>BTM, Yamb and Monopoly have the Croatian translation too. For example, you can play BTM Pro or Yap Yamb over network with your friends from other city or even other country.
<br><br>Portable means that you don't have to install it, you can extract the compressed ZIP file saving it to any folder on disk or USB memory or CD/DVD and can run from that location. 
Eventually, create desktop shortcut. The game data are written in "Documents" folder, subfolder "Drazenware". 
For gaming you only need files "LogyxPack.exe" and "LogyxPack.dll", keeping the optional BTM Pro folders "Decks" and "Background" depends on you. 
I recommend that ALL players use the latest version of Logyx Pack, older versions were sometimes buggy especially in network playing of BTM Pro.

<tr class="ttr"><td class=tekst3><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;Network playing via direct access with BTM Pro or Yap Yamb</b></td></tr><tr class="ttr2"><td><div class="dd tekst">
Users of BTM or Yamb could have an issue about making connections when playing over network. Basic thing is that you have to configure firewalls and other filters to not to block connections. There is a big difference when playing between LAN and Internet. When playing over company or home LAN usually there shouldn't have been any of issues. Commonly you can forget playing over Internet in a company. Home users can have an issue making these games running as TCP servers over Internet. To make easier this, BTM and Yamb use UPnP port mapping. If you can't make BTM or Yamb acting as a TCP server, maybe other players whom you play with can do that, there is a need for only one player that can do that.<br><br>
<i>Q: How can I configure my router?</i><br>
A: By accessing to router's application from any web browser, you have to know LAN internal address of a router. You can also ask your ISP for that address.<br><br>
<i>Q: How can I enable UPnP on my router?</i><br>
A: In order to UPnP port mapping to work, "Try UPnP port mapping" in "Game --> Options" submenu in Logyx Pack must be ticked, and your router has to be UPnP capable and enabled. If UPnP is not enabled by default you can enable it through router's application. Enabling UPnP can be a security risk, if you are not advanced computer user, better skip that.<br><br>
<i>Q: How to configure port forwarding on a router?</i><br>
A: You can do that if UPnP port mapping fails, or if you don't want using UPnP. That is done only once on a router for a particular game. You should also open that port for listening in that game.<br><br>
<i>Q: How to manually open a port for listening in BTM or Yamb?</i><br>
A: When you tick "This computer is a server", untick "Automatic" and enter a port number.<br><br>
<i>Q: What do messages "Error" or "Network error" mean?</i><br>
A: Network playing via direct access is sensitive on every network error, unlike playing on Game Server, and it isn't a bug in a program. Usually it is network error and after that you should start a command "New Game" or reload a game, and make the connections again.<br><br>
<i>Q: How to find external IP address if BTM or Yamb fails to find?</i><br>
A: Web sites such as <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com" target="_blank" class="ob">whatismyip.com</a> can let you know which is your external IP address. If you are behind a router, also router's application should tell you that.

<tr class="ttr"><td class=tekst3><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;About Game Server, BTM Pro and Yap Yamb</b></td></tr><tr class="ttr2"><td><div class="dd tekst">
Games BTM Pro and Yap Yamb use HTTP Game Server, on which you can connect without logging in, playing private games with your friends or public games with players only from your country.<br>Direct network playing via IP addresses is much faster then Game Server. Main advantage of Game Server are public games, and playing is much easier to configure, since there are only outgoing requests which you allow on firewall. Sometimes it is necessary for me to deny access to Game Server from older versions of these games because of synchronization, bugs or improvements. Then you could download the newest version of game.
